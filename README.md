look for
======

  Client-side full-text search using CSS and built for speed.

## Installation

with component:

    $ component install bredele/lookfor

with nodejs:

    $ npm install lookfor


## Usage


  `lookfor` uses dataset (`data-search`) to index dom elements...

```html
<div class="searchable" data-search="beep"></div>
<div class="searchable" data-search="beepandboop"></div>
```

  ...and dynamically creates and updates a stylesheet node for search. 

```js
var search = require('lookfor')();

search('beep');
search('boop');
```

  see [examples](https://github.com/bredele/lookfor/blob/master/examples/index.html).
  

## How does it work?
 
  `lookfor` relies on CSS3 selectors (such as `:not()` and `[attr*=]`) rather than JavaScript. Instead changing one by one all the elements matching the query, `lookfor` updates the inner HTML of a single `<style>` element. Here's an example:

```html
<style>
	.searchable:not([data-search*='beep']) {
		display: none;
	}
</style>
```

  The browser does all the work and won't trigger unnecessary repain/relayout mechanism.
